#EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The South Bay Salt Pond Restoration Project (SBSPRP) is restoring historic salt evaporation ponds to a mix of tidal marsh habitat and managed ponds to improve wildlife habitat, flood protection, and public access. Evaluating wildlife response to the actions of this multi-decade restoration project is essential for sustaining baseline populations. At the outset of the project, the SBSPRP and regulatory agencies defined targets, triggers, and thresholds for waterbird populations in the project area and/or South San Francisco Bay. With more than a decade of monitoring data available, it is possible to assess our ability to use current monitoring data to detect these trends, and our ability to decrease survey effort while maintaining our ability to address project objectives. To evaluate the effectiveness of decreased effort, it is necessary to perform a power analysis, which defines the power to detect changes in waterbird counts over time. We used a simulation approach to calculate detection power given the variability in waterbird counts from current monitoring protocols. Analyses suggest that triggers, which specify counts below baselines without an associated statistical test, may be essential for responding to declines within an effective timeframe, as NEPA/CEQA significance thresholds require extensive monitoring periods to detect declines for some species. We suggest that survey efforts are maintained at two surveys per peak season for species of interest, and that future analyses assess the effect of monitoring fewer sites to detection power. We strongly suggest that a consensus is reached regarding the interpretation and statistical assessment of NEPA/CEQA significance thresholds, as the approach has implications for the power to detect trends and the requirements of monitoring surveys.

#BACKGROUND
The South Bay Salt Pond Restoration Project (SBSPRP) is the largest tidal wetland restoration project on the West Coast of the Americas and aims to restore 50-90% of 15,100 acres of historic commercial salt evaporation ponds to tidal marsh in multiple decades. As an adaptive management project, the success of the SBSPRP depends greatly on using the best science to guide current and future management actions such that the resulting total project area supports a diverse species assemblage. In particular, assessments based on extensive monitoring are needed to fulfill SBSPRP Objective 1: “Create, restore, or enhance habitats of sufficient size, function, and appropriate structure to…[m]aintain current migratory bird species that utilize existing salt ponds and associated structures such as levees” (SBSPRP Final Environmental Impact Statement/Report 2007).

##Objectives
SFBBO has been monitoring waterbirds in SBSPRP sites and surrounding Cargill ponds since 2003, and our data are reported annually to the SBSPRP Management Team. Our task is to assess ongoing monitoring efforts to ensure that they are both effective for evaluating SBSPRP targets and efficient to ensure sustainability. Specifically, we aimed to determine an approach that (1) is more resource efficient than current survey protocols, and (2) can be used to answer the question of whether waterbird populations in the South Bay are above or below targets set by the SBSPRP. We also sought protocols that generate data that are directly comparable to counts from previous years.

#Approach
##Waterbird Surveys
We conducted waterbird surveys at each of the 82 ponds in the Alviso, Coyote Hills, Dumbarton, Eden Landing, Mowry, and Ravenswood complexes. We performed surveys exclusively at high tide, defined as a tide of 4.0 feet or greater at the Alameda Creek Tide Sub-Station (37° 35.70' N, 122° 08.70' W). During each survey, we observed birds from the nearest drivable road or levee using spotting scopes and binoculars. We counted the total number of individuals of all waterbird species present on each pond and recorded the location of each using aerial site photos superimposed with 250 m2 individually labeled grids. For each grid-scale sighting of an individual bird or bird group of the same species, we recorded behavioral data (whether the bird or bird group was foraging or roosting). For roosting birds only, we recorded whether we observed the bird or bird group on a levee, an island, or a manmade/artificial structure (e.g., blind, fence post).  Pond surveys were randomized as follows: ponds were split into 6 groups based on geographic location and pond complex (Newark & Mowry, Northern Eden Landing, Southern Eden Landing, Ravenswood, Western Alviso, Eastern Alviso), a random list of these groups was generated, field crews surveyed any accessible ponds within 1 area each survey day and moved to the next area if no ponds were accessible in that area. All 82 ponds were surveyed 7 times per year and during each of the 7 survey periods, all ponds were surveyed within 6 weeks.

We identified birds to the species level whenever possible, with the exception of Long-billed and Short-billed Dowitchers (identified as Dowitchers), and Greater and Lesser Scaup (identified as Scaup). When species identification was not possible, we identified birds to genus (e.g., Calidris) or foraging guild (e.g., gulls, small shorebirds, medium shorebirds, phalaropes). 

##Subsetting Protocols and Trend Detection
We used power analyses and simulations informed by our existing dataset to explore the feasibility of decreasing survey effort using a subsetting protocol. We focused on a subset approach because previous analyses (Tarjan & Heyse 2018) concluded that sampling frequency should remain at current rates (two times in the peak season for a given species) in order to detect ten-year trends in waterbird abundance with sufficient power (beta = 0.80). We 1) researched approaches for decreasing survey effort by subsetting the sites, and 2) evaluated the effect of the subset protocol on our ability to detect trends following methods by Tarjan and Heyse (2018).

The ideal subset of sites would yield counts that are representative of the population. Counts from a subset of sites can become biased if birds shift their locations over time. The potential for this "frame bias" (Bart et al. 2005) leaves researchers unsure of whether a decline occurred due to a decline in the larger population or due to movement away from the surveyed sites (i.e. the frame) over time. A second type of bias called selection bias arises when some sites cannot be surveyed due to access restrictions.

Earlier work by Wood et al. (2010) simulated shorebird counts from sites within the San Francisco Bay Area to evaluate the accuracy and precision of eight subsetting protocols. They tested variations of random sampling, stratification by region such that each region was equally represented in the subsample, and site selection weighted by the abundance of shorebirds in historical data. Based on their assessment of accuracy and precision, they recommended random selection of sites that are weighted using historical data for annual surveys, and stipulated that remaining sites are surveyed every ten years to check for frame bias (i.e. movement of birds between sites). They concluded that with this scheme, survey effort could be reduced by up to 75% and still deliver accurate (+/- 20%) estimates of 20-year population trends at 0.05 and/or 0.15 power.

We applied Wood et al.'s approach with modifications to the geographic scope, species, and detection criteria to identify feasible reductions in survey effort for the SBSPRP.  Previous analyses (Tarjan & Heyse 2018) revealed that survey frequency needs to remain at current levels (twice during the peak season for any given species) to detect Project targets. These results are in agreement with Wood et al.'s findings that decreasing survey effort by 50% (from every one to every two years) dramatically lowers power. An alternative approach to decrease survey effort is to survey fewer locations, which we evaluate here. We evaluated our ability to detect trends under sampling schemes where we sample 100%, 50% and 25% of survey sites.

Our first goal was to identify a subset of sites that would represent counts yielding a trend of waterbird counts over time of +/- 20% of the estimate from the full dataset (Wood et al. 2010). We assumed that another goal of subsetting sites is to have a collection of sites that is representative of the entire project footprint in terms of species composition and diversity. Upholding this assumption facilitiates comparison of new data with historical data. We used a similarity index to evaluate how representative counts in a subset are to counts in the entire sample. This similarity assessment was implemented using the bioenv function in the Vegan package (Oksanen et al. 2019) in R. We selected a set of sites with a rho value of at least 0.95 when compared with the full set of sites in terms of species composition and relative abundance. 

The community was represented by a small number of ponds (<10), so we added sites of interest as defined by the Project Management Team, which comprised: `r wish.list`. Justification for inclusion of these ponds is provided in Appendix I. 

We added subsequent ponds using a stratified and weighted approach following Wood et al. (2010), where the sites (which we define as ponds) were stratified by "pond type"" and weighted by historical bird abudance. Pond types were defined as (a) salt pond, (b) managed pond, (c) enhanced pond, and (d) restored/breached pond. Sites that were enhanced or breached in Phase I and planned for Phase II were pooled in these categorizations (i.e., a pond that was slated for enhancement in Phase II was placed in the "enhanced pond" category in this analysis). The birds within the SBSPRP represent diverse guilds (e.g. shorebirds, dabbling ducks, diving ducks) so their habitat preferences differ and high density areas are not necessarily representative of the preferred area for all species. To incorporate representative sites for all guilds and species of interest, we randomly selected sites weighted by density for each guild/species of interest, comprising `r speciesIO`. We then randomized the order of guilds/species and selected the top sites in sequential order for each guild/species until the target number of sites was reached. Note that Eared Grebe are a species of concern due to their reliance on salt production ponds, so we included ponds outside of the project footprint (i.e. ponds in the Mowry and Newark pond complexes) in this part of the selection process.

We then selected the best sets of sites based on current and future accessibility.

<!--...habitat type = managed pond or restored tidal marsh...weighting takes into account multiple species...adapts based on which species are already covered?? somewhat stochastic weights??-->

#Results
##Site Subsets and Trend Detection
Based on the similarity index, the community in the SBSPRP footprint was well-represented by the following ponds: **`r set.select`**. Average counts by guild for this subset of ponds compared with the entire set of ponds were very similar, with rho = `r round(sets2$order.by.best$rho[1],2)`. In addition to these `r length(set.select)` ponds, we manually added the following ponds based on the criteria described above: `r wish.list`. Finally, we added

Subsetting sites leads to counts that dampen the effects of increases and declines. This means that threshold percent changes for detection should be altered if data are only collected for a subset of sites. This also means that short-lived declines (over periods of three years) may be missed.



##Preliminary Updates to Survey Methods
During meetings of members of the SBSPRP Science Advisory Committee in 2018, it was determined that assigning birds to 250 m by 250 m grids within each pond was no longer necessary to address upcoming questions for the SBSPRP. The grid assignments were useful in addressing questions about habitat use within each pond. The committee determined that the community has gained a sufficient understanding of habitat use within the ponds, and that grid assignment is no longer needed. SFBBO eliminated this procedure from survey protocols in January 2019. This brief analysis addresses the question of whether ceasing assignment to grids affected the duration of the survey protocol. To date, SFBBO has conducted `r nrow(unique(subset(dat.sfbbo, subset = grids ==T, select=Survey)))` survey rounds with grid assignments, and `r nrow(unique(subset(dat.sfbbo, subset = grids ==F, select=Survey)))` survey rounds without grid assignments. A t-test comparing survey duration for surveys with versus without grid assignments showed that there is no detectable difference between survey duration using the two protocols (t = `r round(duration.test$statistic, 2)`, DF = `r round(duration.test$parameter, 2)`, p = `r round(duration.test$p.value, 2)`) (Figure 1).

##Survey Cost
```{r, echo=FALSE}
cost.goal<-50000
new.staff.hrs<-round((cost.goal - (91144.12-(2377.25+394)*0.7*mean(c(17.77*1.284,24.62*1.284))))/mean(c(17.77*1.284,24.62*1.284)),0)
new.staff.hrs.cost<-round(cost.goal - (91144.12-(2377.25+394)*0.7*mean(c(17.77*1.284,24.62*1.284))),2)
```

The three-year average of annual spending for 2015-2017 is \$84371.46. We sought a survey protocol that could be implemented on an annual budget of \$`r cost.goal`, which represents a `r round((84371.46-cost.goal)/84371.46*100,0)`% decrease in survey costs. See Appendix I for a previous project budget. Reductions in budget items will depend on how the protocol changes are implemented. We expect that the following costs would remain the same with a new survey protocol, assuming the protocol was implemented with the same frequency: data analysis, data management, meetings, project management, and report writing, as well as supplies, mileage and tolls, and conferences. Reduced costs would be reflected in fewer staff hours spent on data entry and field work. Past data entry required 394 hours, while field work required 2377.25 hours each year. Roughly 30% of these hours can be fulfilled by interns. The rate for interns will remain at a minimum of $500 per month. Achieving the goal for cost decreases requires that staff hours on field work and data entry are decreased to `r new.staff.hrs` total hours, which would cost \$`r new.staff.hrs.cost` with overhead. Maintaining the ratio of field work hours to data entry hours indicates that staff would need to spend `r new.staff.hrs*0.858` hours on fieldwork and `r new.staff.hrs*0.142` hours on data entry, which represents a `r round(((2377.25+394)-new.staff.hrs)/(2377.25+394)*100,0)`% reduction in field work hours.
